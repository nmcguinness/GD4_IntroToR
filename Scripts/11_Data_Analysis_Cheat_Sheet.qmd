# Key Statistical Terms and Definitions

## Data Types

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Categorical Data** | Data that can be divided into groups or categories |
| **Nominal Data** | Categories with no inherent order (e.g., colors, gender) |
| **Ordinal Data** | Categories with a meaningful order (e.g., ratings, education level) |
| **Numerical Data** | Data with mathematical meaning that can be measured |
| **Discrete Data** | Numerical data with countable, separate values (e.g., number of children) |
| **Continuous Data** | Numerical data that can take any value within a range (e.g., height, time) |

## Descriptive Statistics

### Measures of Central Tendency

| Term | Definition | R Function |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Mean** | The average of all values (sum divided by count) | `mean()` |

| **Mode** | The most frequently occurring value | `table()` |

### Measures of Dispersion

| Term | Definition | R Function |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Range** | Difference between maximum and minimum values | `max() - min()` |
| **Variance** | Average of squared differences from the mean | `var()` |
| **Standard Deviation** | Square root of variance; shows spread of data | `sd()` |

| **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)** | Statement of effect or difference |
| **p-value** | Probability of observing results if null hypothesis is true |
| **Alpha Level (α)** | Threshold for statistical significance (typically 0.05) |
| **Type I Error** | Rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive) |

| **Coefficient** | Estimated effect of predictor on outcome | `coef()` |
| **Intercept** | Predicted value when all predictors equal zero | `coef()[1]` |
| **Slope** | Change in outcome per unit change in predictor | `coef()[2]` |

## Data Cleaning Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Missing Values** | Data points with no recorded value (NA in R) |
| **Outlier** | Data point that differs significantly from other observations |
| **Data Imputation** | Replacing missing values with estimated values |
| **Data Transformation** | Converting data to improve analysis (e.g., log transform) |
| **Standardization** | Rescaling data to have mean=0 and SD=1 |
| **Normalization** | Rescaling data to range between 0 and 1 |

## R Data Analysis Functions

| Function | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `summary()` | Provides summary statistics for data | `summary(data)` |
| `str()` | Shows structure of data | `str(data)` |
| `head()` | Shows first few rows of data | `head(data)` |
| `table()` | Creates frequency table | `table(data$variable)` |
| `aggregate()` | Computes statistics by group | `aggregate(y ~ x, data, mean)` |
| `subset()` | Filters data based on condition | `subset(data, variable > 10)` |

# Common Data Analysis Pitfalls

1. **Correlation ≠ Causation**: A correlation between variables doesn't mean one causes the other

2. **Selection Bias**: Non-random sample selection that doesn't represent the population

3. **Overfitting**: Creating a model that fits training data too closely but performs poorly on new data

4. **Multiple Testing Problem**: Running many tests increases chance of false positives

5. **Simpson's Paradox**: A trend that appears in groups of data disappears when groups are combined

6. **Confirmation Bias**: Focusing on data that confirms prior beliefs

7. **Outlier Sensitivity**: Some statistics (like mean) are strongly affected by outliers

# Step-by-Step Data Analysis Process

1. **Define Question**: Clearly define the problem or question to be answered

2. **Collect Data**: Gather relevant data through surveys, experiments, or existing datasets

3. **Clean Data**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, correct errors

4. **Explore Data**: Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand patterns

5. **Analyze Data**: Apply appropriate statistical methods based on research questions

6. **Interpret Results**: Draw conclusions based on analysis

7. **Communicate Findings**: Present results through reports, visualizations, or presentations
