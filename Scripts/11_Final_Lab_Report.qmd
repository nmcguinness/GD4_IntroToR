## Executive Summary (150 words) [^notes1]
**Purpose of Testing:**  
**Key Findings (Summary):**  
**Recommendations (Summary):**

[^notes1]:
- **Purpose**: Provide a high‑level overview for stakeholders who need a quick read.
- **Key Findings**: Emphasise the most critical or impactful insights.
- **Recommendations**: Summarise high‑level suggestions.
- *Example:*  
  > *“This user‑testing session aimed to identify major usability issues in the new tutorial level.  
  > Key findings indicate that players struggled with the crafting interface, prompting an immediate redesign.  
  > We recommend streamlining the interface and adding in‑game hints.”*

## Introduction (200 words) [^notes2]
**Context & Background:**  
**Scope of Testing:**  
**Objectives:**

[^notes2]:
- **Context & Background**: Summarise the game’s genre, platform, and development stage (Alpha, Beta, etc.).
- **Scope**: State what specifically is being tested (tutorial, first two levels, etc.).
- **Objectives**: Outline the specific questions or goals (e.g., “Is the new resource system intuitive?”).

## Methodology (250 words) [^notes3]
**Test Design & Approach:**  
**Test Scenarios / Tasks:**  
**Metrics Collected:**

[^notes3]:
- Describe **how** you conducted the tests (usability tests, playtests, think‑aloud protocol).
- Mention if sessions were **remote** (Zoom, Skype) or **in‑person**.
- *Example tasks:* *Complete a tutorial, fight the first boss, etc.*
- List metrics collected (*time on task, error rates, user comments*).

## Participants (150 words) [^notes4]
**Recruitment & Criteria:**  
**Number & Demographics:**  
**Consent & Ethics:**

[^notes4]:
- Explain how participants were **recruited** (friends, professional testers, random volunteers).
- Include **demographics** if relevant (e.g., gaming background, age range).
- Note any **ethical steps** (informed consent, confidentiality agreements).

## Materials \& Tools (150 words) [^notes5]
**Software / Hardware Specs:**  
**Testing Environment:**  
**Data‑capture Tools:**

[^notes5]:
- Detail specific **hardware/software** used (OS, CPU, game build version).
- State if sessions occurred in a **lab setting**, living room, or online.
- Note any **recording or survey tools** (OBS Studio, Google Forms, etc.).

## Procedure (200 words) [^notes6]
**Session Flow:**  
**Facilitator & Observer Roles:**  
**Instructions to Participants:**  
**Session Duration:**

[^notes6]:
- Provide a **step‑by‑step** sequence of the testing process.
- *Example:*  
  1. Welcome & consent forms  
  2. Brief explanation of game controls  
  3. 15‑minute play session with think‑aloud feedback  
  4. Post‑test interview or questionnaire

## Data Analysis (400 words) 
### Quantitative Analysis (numerical survey items)
1. **Select 3–4 key numeric variables.**
2. **Descriptive statistics** – *n, mean, median, SD, min, max*.
3. **Distribution plots** – *maximum 3 plots per variable* (e.g., histogram, box‑and‑whisker, QQ). Comment on modality, skewness, outliers.
4. **Normality check** – QQ‑plot plus Shapiro‑Wilk (*n ≤ 50*); report statistic & *p*. State conclusion (*α = 0.05*).
5. **Relationship analysis** – choose the two most related numeric variables and justify.  
   * Scatter‑plot with fitted regression line (counts as one of the three plots for each variable).  
   * Report Pearson’s *r* (Spearman’s ρ if non‑normal).  
   * Linear regression \(y = β₀ + β₁x\): β, SE, *t*, *p*, 95 % CI, *R²*.
  * *R hint:* After running `model <- lm(y ~ x, data = df)`, open `summary(model)` and report:
    * **Coefficients** table — *Estimate* (β), *Std. Error*, *t value*, *Pr(>|t|)* for both the intercept and slope.
    * Bottom‑line **Multiple R‑squared** (and *Adjusted R‑squared* if *n* is small).

### Qualitative Analysis (if applicable) [^notes7]
Summarise open‑text answers as themes.

### Key Observations
Highlight surprising patterns or anomalies.

[^notes7]:
- Use **code** (R, Python or Excel) to generate all statistics and plots.
- Include scripts/outputs in **Appendix A** (these are excluded from the word count).

## Results (400 words) [^notes8]
### Findings by Category
* **Descriptive statistics table** – one row per variable.
* Up‑to‑three illustrative plots per variable with concise captions.

### Critical Issues
Note non‑normal variables, serious outliers or assumption breaches.

### Positive Outcomes \& Relationships
Present regression results and practical significance.

_All detailed numeric output belongs in the appendix._

[^notes8]:
- Present findings clearly (bullet points, charts or tables).
- Separate major categories (*UI, mechanics, performance*, etc.).
- Highlight strong positives (*fun moments, effective features*) and pain points (*confusion, crashes*).

## Discussion (250 words) [^notes9]
Interpret how the results answer your objectives and compare with expectations.

[^notes9]:
- Relate findings back to **objectives**.
- Mention **unexpected results** or whether goals were met.
- Discuss study **constraints** (small sample, only one device type).

## Recommendations (200 words) [^notes10]
Prioritised improvements and a brief action roadmap.

[^notes10]:
- List changes or fixes, ideally in **priority order** (*must‑fix* vs. *optional*).
- Provide a direct **roadmap** for the dev team.
- *Example:*  
  > *“We recommend redesigning the crafting menu, adding a tooltip for each resource.  
  > In the next round of testing, we’ll focus on verifying these changes.”*

## Conclusion (150 words) [^notes11]
Concise restatement of the most important takeaway and next steps.

[^notes11]:
- Recap the overall **impact** of the user‑testing results.
- Reinforce the **benefit** of findings for final product quality.
- Mention upcoming **milestones or expansions** that might also need testing.

## References (excluded from word count) [^notes12]
List any literature, standards or tools cited.

[^notes12]:
- If you cited any research or used external guides/methodologies, list them here.
- *Example:*  
  > - Nielsen, J. (1994). *Usability inspection methods.*  
  > - ISO 9241‑11:2018. *Ergonomics of human–system interaction.*

## Appendices (optional, excluded from word count) [^notes13]
**A. Links to Raw Data / Scripts**  
**B. Links to Screenshots / Videos**  
**C. Links to Questionnaires & Scripts**
